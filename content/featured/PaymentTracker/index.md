This financial overview screen displays a student's payment status for a course, with sections for next due amount, total paid, and outstanding balance. It lists installments with due dates and statusesâ€”highlighting overdue payments. There's an option to upgrade to a premium course module, alongside a countdown to the next payment due. The sidebar provides detailed billing information and a request change option.
