- Began my journey at XposedGeek with a simple passion: I loved their content. So much so, I reached out and soon found myself diving headfirst into the world of blogging.
- While there, I got my hands dirty with Affiliate Marketing, learned the ropes of SEO, played around with WordPress, and got acquainted with AdSense.
- And the cherry on top? We saw a big uptick in website traffic during my time there.
