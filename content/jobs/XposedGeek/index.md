- Began my journey at XposedGeek with a simple passion: I loved their content. So much so, I reached out and started writing content for them.
- While there, I got my hands dirty with Affiliate Marketing, learnt SEO, played around with WordPress, and got acquainted with AdSense.
- The website traffic grew to nearly 50,000 views per month.
