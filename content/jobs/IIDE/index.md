- Currently, I am heading two teams at IIDE - one focused on the Learning Management System, and the other on Automation initiatives. For the LMS, I oversee both frontend and backend teams, coming up with new designs and managing all aspects of the system. On the Automation side, I lead builds of various systems to help scale operations, including invoicing, placement portals, reports, CRM, IVR, and ticketing software.
- I got an opportunity for training at IIDE. I started by teaching courses on WordPress, SEO, blogging, AdSense, affiliate marketing, email marketing, CRM, chatbots and more. To date, I've trained over 70,000 students and also created training content. My corporate clients have included Mahindra, Volkswagen, Cipla, Pfizer, Publicis Groupe, Leo Burnett, Deepak Group and Atout France.
- Then I started as Data Analyst in 2019, where I worked on integrating platforms such as Freshworks CRM to collect leads, FreshDesk, SlashRTC and worked alongside CEO and COO to synthesize company-wide reports.
- Started my journey in July 2017 as a Web Development Executive and worked on optimizing IIDE's WordPress website. I improved performance by 13x, reducing load time from 40 seconds to just 3 seconds. This resulted in 3x more leads on the website.
