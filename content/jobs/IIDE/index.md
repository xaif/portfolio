- I led two teams at IIDE - one focused on improving the Learning Management System and the other on Business Tech & Innovation. I managed both frontend and backend teams, developed new designs, and handled all aspects of the LMS. On the Automation side, I introduced new software for invoicing, placement portals, reports, CRM, IVR, and ticketing.
- I trained over 50,000 students and created engaging training content, teaching Digital Marketing to companies like Mahindra, Volkswagen, Cipla, Pfizer, Publicis Groupe, Leo Burnett, Deepak Group, and Atout France. My courses included topics such as WordPress, SEO, Blogging, AdSense, Affiliate Marketing, Email Marketing, CRM, chatbots, and more.
- As a Data Analyst, I integrated platforms like Freshworks CRM, FreshDesk, and SlashRTC to improve lead collection and company reporting, working closely with the founders.
- In my role as a Web Development Executive, I optimized IIDE's WordPress website, boosting performance significantly by reducing load time from 40 seconds to 3 seconds, which led to three times more leads.
