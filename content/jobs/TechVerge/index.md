- In 2015, I launched TechVerge, hoping to share tips on remote earnings, free recharges, and nifty tricks.
- By February 2016, I shifted gears, focusing on Android & iPhone tricks. This pivot paid off â€” Google AdSense started rolling in revenue just four months later.
- Dived deep into the world of SEO, understanding its nuances. Along the way, I contributed articles to prominent sites like MissingTricks.net.
- Felt a rush of accomplishment as we hit a milestone: 1 million visits a month!
